The Keypad is a special page that allows you to control your lights using a keypad.  

You must create a [Macro Preset](../admin/presets/macro) to access the Keypad page.

![Keypad editing](@site/static/img/tutorial/control-panel/keypad.png).

To get started, enter a number of the channel you want to use. 

The keypad will check if this is a valid number, and then show a fader to set the level for those addresses. A valid number is:

- A single address, e.g. `1`
- A range of addresses, e.g. `1 thru 200`

It will override the value of the selected channels with the value of the fader, using the priority value set in the configuration.
