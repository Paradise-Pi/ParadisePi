Welcome to the user guide for version 2 of Paradise. [Version 1](/v1) is now discontinued. 

## Basics

Paradise runs on a computer (usually a Raspberry Pi, hence ParadisePi, but it also runs on Windows, Linux & MacOS) usually with a touchscreen. It is comparable to Crestron® and AMX® panels.

Paradise has two parts to the user interface - the **Control Panel** and the **Administration Menu**. The Control Panel is used by users, to trigger presets and faders, and the Administration Menu allows the creation and configuration of presets and faders

The computer running Paradise does not have to be the same computer as the one that is used to interact with the control panel, so it's possible to stash a Raspberry Pi away in a rack somewhere, and use another device such as an iPad to interact with the control panel instead. 

The computer running Paradise creates a web server that can be accessed by other devices on the local network (or exposed to the internet with caution), see the [remote control](control/remote) for more information on how to get connected. This is optional - you can also use the control panel directly from the device its running on. 

## Features

 - Fully customisable control panel interface, with combinations of presets and faders
 - Presets and faders can be grouped into folders to help organise the control panel
 - Simple administration interface providing full control over devices and control panels
 - Web interface to access both control panel and administration remotely
