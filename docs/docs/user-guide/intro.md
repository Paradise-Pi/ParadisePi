Welcome to the user guide for version 2 of Paradise. [Version 1](/v1) is now discontinued. 

## Basics

Paradise runs on a computer (usually a Raspberry Pi, hence ParadisePi, but it also runs on Windows, Linux & MacOS) usually with a touchscreen. It is comparable to Crestron® and AMX® panels.

Paradise has two parts to the user interface - the **Control Panel** and the **Administration Menu**. 

The Control Panel is used by users, to trigger presets and faders, and the Administration Menu allows the creation and configuration of presets and faders
