Presets are the core functionality of Paradise Pi. They allow you to send static information to devices, depending on the preset type. There are four types of preset currently supported:

- [sACN/e1.31 (Lighting)](sacn)
- [OSC (Sound)](osc)
- [HTTP (various)](http)
- [Macro](macro)

## Customisation

---

All Presets have the following options:

- Name
- [Folder](../folders)
- Button Colour - Defaults to #2C2E33
- Fade time - Defaults to 0
- Visibility - whether to show the preset on the preset page

Some presets may have additional information, depending on the preset type. This will be displayed in the edit popup for that preset.

## Creating presets

---

Use the `+` button to create a new preset. You will be prompted to select a preset type, and then a preset will be created with the default options for that type. Before saving, you will need to select a folder for the preset.

It is not possible to change preset types after creation.
