Macros are special presets that can be used to trigger more than one preset at once. Each macro preset can recall one or more other presets, of any type - including other macro presets.

These can be used to trigger presets in multiple folders (such as lighting and sound) - such as turning everything off. They can also be used to show one preset in multiple folders. 

Macro presets can also be used to open certain pages, including the custom [Keypad](../../control/keypad) and [Channel Check](../../control/chan-check) pages for sACN.
