Macros are special presets that can be used to create complex chains of presets. Each macro preset can recall one or more other presets, of any type - including other macro presets.  
They can be particularly useful to "reset" your control equiptment to a known state.

Macro presets can also be used to open certain pages, including the custom [Keypad](../../control/keypad) and [Channel Check](../../control/chan-check) pages for Lighting.
