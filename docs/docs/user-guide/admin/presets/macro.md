Macros are special presets that can be used to trigger more than one preset at once. Each macro preset can recall one or more other presets, of any type - including other macro presets.

These can be used to trigger presets in multiple folders (such as lighting and sound) - such as turning everything off. They can also be used to show one preset in multiple folders. 

Macro presets can also be used to open certain pages, including the custom [Keypad](../../control/keypad) and [Channel Check](../../control/chan-check) pages for sACN.

Macros themselves can be triggered by other macros, allowing you to create complex sequences of presets. They can also be triggered by time events, allowing you to schedule macros to run at certain times (for example to turn off a system at night time).
