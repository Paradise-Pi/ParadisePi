The administraton menu allows you to create and edit your presets, faders and folders, and is where you set up Paradise Pi. 
Configuration contains the settings for the system, such as sACN and OSC options and screensaver customisation.

It is recommended you use the admin menu from a connected browser if possible, as this will allow you to access features such as configuration backups. Some menus have a large number of configurable fields, which will also be easier to use on a larger screen.
