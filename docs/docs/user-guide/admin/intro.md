The administration menu allows you to create and edit your presets, faders and folders - it's where you set up Paradise. 

Configuration contains the settings for the system, such as sACN and OSC options and screensaver customisation.

It is recommended you use the admin menu from a [remote browser](./../control/remote) if possible, as this will allow you to access features such as configuration backups. Some menus have a large number of configurable fields, which will also be easier to use on a larger screen.
