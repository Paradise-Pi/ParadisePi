title: OSC - X32
---

Testing with an X32 is of course the simplest route, but if you don't have one available on your network you can use the [X32 emulator](https://sites.google.com/site/patrickmaillot/x32#h.p_rE4IH0Luimc0) by Patrick-Gilles Maillot. You can download it direct from that site, or if you're having issues it is reproduced [here for Windows](../../../static/downloads/x32-emulator/X32_windows.zip) under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, version 3.

The source code is [available on Github](https://github.com/pmaillot/X32-Behringer/blob/master/X32.c)
